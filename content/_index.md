# **hi : )**

I am **Zhicheng Li**.

currently an Electronic Information Engineering undergraduate in a joint degree program between the University of Glasgow (UK) and UESTC (China).

love sunshine ☀️, hiking 🥾, and daydreaming 🫨—and I’m always trying out new hobbies. I’m interested in learning about, and working on, a wide range of fields, including iOS app development, embedded engineering, and machine learning. I’m also continuously exploring and expanding my knowledge. If you’re looking for someone enthusiastic and ready to learn, I’d love to chat!

You can contact me via email at: zcheng.li@outlook.com or through my social media accounts.
